# Baby's First Digital Synthesizer

My first venture in making digital synthesizers with the JUCE framework for C++

## Purpose
To expand my knowledge for further project development. 

I intend to use this project to familiarize myself with JUCE and VST development such that I can progress to make a VST plugin that shares MIDI data between remote users working on arbitrary projects.

## Project Requirements
* Visual Studio
* JUCE framework (requires manual path declarations within Projucer)
* git
